# Get automatic reply settings

Get the settings for notifying people automatically upon receipt of their email.

Since automatic replies are part of the user's mailbox settings (**automaticRepliesSetting** is a property of 
[mailboxSettings](../resources/mailboxsettings.md)), you can view automatic replies settings by getting 
all mailbox settings. Or, you can get specifically automatic replies settings.
