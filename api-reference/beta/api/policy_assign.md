# Assign Policy

Assigns a [policy](../resources/policy.md) to an application or service principal.

>Note: Currently, policy assignment only applies to token lifetime Policy, and not naming policy. Naming policies cannot be assigned to groups, as they are globally enforced across all groups within the entire organization. The different types of policies can be found in [policy](../resources/policy.md).
